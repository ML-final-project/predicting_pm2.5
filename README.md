A common problem in geophysical research is the lack of suﬃcient ground station data for remote regions of the world. In such situations, simulation without adequate initial parameters results in air quality predictions that contradict both local ground level observations and visual inspection of atmospheric satellite imagery. As a solution to this, we suggest incorporating simple ground level data such as temperature, geographical parameters such as latitude and longitude, temporal information, and satellite observations into a deep learning architecture that will predict ground level PM2.5 concentrations.
